## About Me
I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Bryn Mawr College.

My primary research interests are in industrial organization and international trade, specifically in how the effects of policies (such as tariffs or anti-trust) are moderated by firm market power.

I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Minnesota.
